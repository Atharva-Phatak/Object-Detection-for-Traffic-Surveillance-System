# Object-Detection-for-Traffic-Surveillance-System

## Problem Definition

In India there are many traffic rule violations such as not wearing of helmet, overspeeding, breaking of signals and over loading of two wheelers due to triple seat i.e more than two people are sitting on two wheeler vehicles which as also called as tripsy in India. Deep learning has provided us with the tools to tackle this problem. Specifically we are tackling the problem of detecting triple seats on two wheeler.

## Approach

### Data Collection

Since the formulation of the problem definitions we had a lack of data. Such data  to train deep learning models didn't exist so we collected our own data with 500 images captured at various locations.
